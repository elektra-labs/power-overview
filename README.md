# Proof of Workstyle (PoWer)

## 1. What is PoWer?

**PoWer (Proof of Workstyle)** is a **descriptive framework** for the **value-neutral description of work logics** across different work contexts, including complex knowledge-based work and human–AI collaboration contexts.

PoWer describes **how work is structured**, not how good, efficient, or desirable it is.

The framework operates strictly on a **descriptive level** and makes implicit assumptions about work, collaboration, and cognitive organization **visible and examinable**.

## 2. What PoWer is not

PoWer is **explicitly not**:

* a scoring or ranking system
* an HR, assessment, or selection tool
* a performance, efficiency, or productivity measurement
* a personality or typology model

PoWer evaluates **neither individuals, nor teams, nor outcomes**.

---

## 3. What is PoWer for?

PoWer serves:

* **clear articulation** of different work logics (e.g. between individuals, roles, teams, or systems)
* **mapping** of tasks, work practices, and decision spaces — without evaluation or selection
* **reduction of structural friction** arising from implicit, conflicting, or unarticulated assumptions about work
* **conscious and responsible design** of collaboration between humans as well as between humans and AI

For **individuals**, PoWer provides linguistic and structural orientation regarding their own work logic.

For **teams, organizations, and institutions**, PoWer enables a shared understanding of different ways of working without standardizing or homogenizing them.

The goal is **orientation, transparency, and understanding** — not optimization, evaluation, or selection.

PoWer itself **does not assign**, **does not recommend**, and **does not derive decisions**; such applications lie explicitly outside the scope of the framework.

## 4. Status

PoWer is currently in an **active consolidation phase**.

* Core assumptions and structural principles are considered stable
* Extensions and application scenarios intentionally remain open
* The **methodological core is not publicly accessible**

This repository serves **exclusively as an overview of the module at the meta level**. It provides conceptual positioning and terminological orientation without granting insight into the methodological elaboration, internal structural models, or concrete implementations.

PoWer is an independent framework embedded as a module within a broader descriptive infrastructure (DEIA – Descriptive Infrastructure for AI).

## 5. Access & use

The PoWer core methodology and detailed structures are **not public**.

* Possible access to parts of the methodology may be **considered upon request and by individual agreement** for research, evaluation, or licensing discussions
* Any use requires **prior clarification of context, scope, and boundaries**

There is **no implicit permission** for implementation, derivation, or commercial use.

## 6. Prior art & authorship

PoWer (Proof of Workstyle) is an independently developed framework.
The concept, terminological architecture, and structural foundations were developed and are continuously consolidated by the author.

This repository also serves the **temporal and substantive documentation (prior art)** of the conceptual meta level **as well as the existence and authorship of the non-public methodological core**. It does not constitute permission for use, implementation, or derivation.
